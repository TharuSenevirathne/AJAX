# 🌐 AJAX

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web pages to communicate with a server without reloading the entire page.<br>
🔹 Enables dynamic content updates<br>
🔹 Uses technologies like XMLHttpRequest or modern fetch()<br>
🔹 Often used to load data from APIs without refreshing the UI<br>

# 🧠 How AJAX Works
- User triggers an event (e.g., clicks a button)
- JavaScript sends a request to the server
- Server processes it and sends back a response
- JavaScript updates the page with new data without full reload
